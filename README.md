# Cpp-Unpolished
Stuff I've made in cpp that isn't pretty or ready for other use

# Requirements
- SDL2 (== 2.0.9)
- glfw (== 3.3)
- CMake (>= 2.8.11)
- Doxygen
- GLM (>= 0.9.9.5)

# Setup
Put the SDL & glfw source folders in the project directory where all the other project folders are
Put the GLM "glm" folder (the one with the header files in) in GeneralLib/include (So it's GeneralLib/include/glm)
